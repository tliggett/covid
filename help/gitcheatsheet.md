# GIT CHEATSHEET

## What is it?

Git is a version control service (VCS). It keeps track of versions of your code so you don't lose progress. It also makes it easier (possible) to code with others.

## How do I use it?

Without getting into conflicts/branching, the basic things you can do with git are:

1. **pull:** pull down changes from the remote repository.
2. **add:** Add/Stage your changes to be committed to your local repository. 
3. **commit:** Commit your changes to your local repository.
4. **push:** Push your changes to a remote repository.

## COMMANDS

Use the following commands for your git endeavors

To pull new changes:

`git clone <REMOTE REPOSITORY>`

To add changes locally:

`git add --all`

`git commit -m "<YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE>"`

To push new changes to remote:

`git push`
